# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

The Culinary Collab aims to provide a free, one-stop platform for both professionals and hobbyists to be able to create, ideate, iterate, and share recipes amongst friends and coworkers. We strive to eliminate the mess and hassle of overpacked binders, disorganized notepads, and misplaced recipes (scribbled on old napkins–We know you can’t find them). The Culinary Collab is the answer to your search for a space where you can create and organize house recipes, work from templates, make the most of your inventory, and best of all share this process amongst your friends, family, and coworkers!

## Methods


1. User Personas & Scenarios: Initialized process with the end user in mind and expanded to reach beyond the target audience. Primary audience/user focused on professional use within restaurant/bar environment. Expansion broadened to home users, ranging from novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert (applicable both in professional and home users).

2. Competitive Market Analysis: Completed research over the course of 3 days for competitors offering the same or similar services to The Culinary Collabs mission. Looking in-depth on both Android and iOS app stores in addition to web platforms. The primary condition was a collaborative workspace (without a paywall).

3. Heuristic Evaluation: Employed heuristic analysis, where members of our team worked independently to evaluate competitors to reach a consensus on common usability concerns. Heuristics used were: visibility of system status; the match between the system and the real world; user control and freedom; consistency and standards; error prevention; recognition rather than recall; flexibility and efficiency of use; aesthetic and minimalist design; help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors; help and documentation.

4. Sketches: Drew preliminary sketches of different ideas for how the user interface and layouts of the product could look. Each member of the team independently came up with their own ideas before collaboration in order to encourage different ideas and viewpoints in the research process. In the end, the ideas were discussed together and we settled on a design that seemed to combine the best ideas from each sketch.

5. User Testing: Demonstrated the current progress on the product to an audience of software engineers who provided feedback and answers to the following questions:

* Is it more useful to start on the menu home page, or would it be more helpful to start from your personal recipes?
* Is there any feature that is missing (or lacking) that you would need within the app?
* How would our users think about creating a new recipe? Template? Original/blank screen, etc.?

## Findings

1. User Personas & Scenarios:
Each member of our team independently created 3 user personas and 1 user scenario each. Afterward, we evaluated each persona and scenario as a team, making suggestions and edits to ensure a well-rounded persona and realistic scenario were in place.

With each different persona and scenario, we were able to understand the span of our potential user's utilization of the product. This illuminated our team's understanding of our user to a more broadened target audience, expanding into a home audience in addition to the initial bar/restaurant professional.

3. Competitive Market Analysis:
Through CMA, our team discovered a lack of resources for free collaborative workspaces to house recipes and templates, with the use of current inventories, for both food and drinks.

No one product had all the qualifications met. These qualifications included, but are not limited to:
* Free/no paywall
* Communication Feed
* Recipe templates with Inventory incorporation

5. Heuristic Evaluation
Through heuristic evaluation, we analyzed how a couple of different competitors met certain user goals.

Each member of our team performed an independent heuristic evaluation of a competitor.

Member A:
Member A evaluated the iOS app of competitor Highball on the predefined common heuristics.

Member A found that Highball scored high in aesthetic design, visibility of system statuses, and match between the system and the real world. Meanwhile, they found that it scored poorly in consistency and standards, error recovery, and documentation. The other heuristics performed okay but were missing some functionality or had some kind of limitation that made the experience worse.

Full heuristic evaluation from Member A:

* Visibility of system status: 10/10
There is no waiting game of whether the application is loading, starting,
etc. It starts up right away.

* Match between system and the real world: 9/10
The mapping of highball is pretty good. The entire application exists on
the main screen within the Rolodex of the recipes; to dive in further you click on the recipe name/tab and it expands. The application is set up in a rolodex format, which invites the user to scroll.

* User control and freedom: 4/10
Limitations on control of text instructions. Not clear on how to go back to the full recipe list if you click on the wrong recipe, or are done editing a recipe, etc.

* Consistency and standards: 3/10
Consistent scroll feature, and similarity to the “old school” rolodex. The search feature is hidden/not visible. For example, if you have an extensive list and you cannot find a recipe, my first inclination is to just scroll through and find via sight search

* Error prevention: 5/10
There isn’t a high room for error to begin with when using the app. However, if you make a change to a recipe, there are no warning signs that something has been edited/changed. This could loss important data for the user.

* Recognition rather than recall: 7/10
I think that the recipe template is a very recognizable outline. You have the ingredients at the top and some description (text box) in the middle. The text box for submitting directions needs work. It will not allow for “return” lines which makes for a lot of run-on sentences and hard readability at times.

* Flexibility and efficiency of use: 7/10
The app is very smooth while running. I find the scroll of different ingredient measurements/units extremely efficient. However, the flexibility of different/diverse types of measurements is limited by the programmed units of measure.

* Aesthetic and minimalist design: 10/10
Very visually pleasing. Has the ability to be color-coded to user preference, i.e., to help to organize, preferred colors, etc.

* Error recognition and recovery: 4/10
Not a lot of room for error, however, as previously mentioned there is no prevention in permanent changes.

* Help and documentation: 1/10
There is no instruction or tutorial upon downloading. You are kind of on your own in terms.

Member B:
Member B evaluated the iOS app of competitor Highball on the predefined common heuristics.

Member B identified the following user goals to consider performing while evaluating the heuristics:

Inventory of items available
Search for specific drink recipes
Browse through products
ETAs for recipe prep time
Share recipes with others
Follow others and their recipes
View recipes based on ingredients in inventory
Member B noted that Highball performed best on the visibility of system status, error prevention, recognition rather than recall, and aesthetic and minimalist design heuristics. In contrast, Highball performed most poorly on error recovery and documentation. On most other heuristics, Highball tended to be okay but lacked certain features or abilities that made it fail to meet the user goals for the product.

Full heuristic evaluation from Member B:

* Visibility of system status: 8/10
The loading indicator appears after a short delay and needs more responsive feedback.

* Match between the system and the real world: 6/10
Visually represents drinks with real-world icons but lacks features like inventory linkage.

* User control and freedom: 5/10
Limited control over displayed drinks, stuck in an endless list format.

* Consistency and standards: 4/10
Inconsistent interface elements, non-standard layout, and varied button placements.

* Error prevention: 7/10
Mostly error-free but confusion arises with ambiguous quantity representations.

* Recognition rather than recall: 8/10
UI elements are recognizable; minor quirks exist, like the need to recall swipe actions.

* Flexibility and efficiency of use: 6/10
Limited functionality for broader goals, lacks inventory system and efficient collaboration features.

* Aesthetic and minimalist design: 7/10
Nonstandard layout which needs improvement in customization options and view styles.

* Error recognition and recovery: 2/10
Crashes without feedback when denied access permissions.

* Help and documentation: 2/10
Lacks visible help or documentation beyond basic UI labels.

Member C:
Member C evaluated the Android app of competitor My Cocktail Bar. Member C chose to evaluate a different option since Highball is only available on iOS and not Android.

Member C identified the user goals broadly as “Browse and Search Drinks and Recipes”

* Visibility of system status: 10/10
The screen you are on is always clear.

* Match between system and the real world: 8/10
Not 100% applicable, but scrolling is good.

* User control and freedom: 8/10

* Consistency and standards: 10/10
Common measurements and ingredients included standard interface elements throughout.

* Error prevention: 8/10
A fair amount of confirmations for actions that could cause errors.

* Recognition rather than recall: 10/10
Gives lots of tooltips to help users infer uses.

* Flexibility and efficiency of use: 9/10
Additional features can be enabled by power users, creative new recipes, cloud sync, etc.

* Aesthetic and minimalist design: 3/10
Ads suck aesthetically and create visual clutter. The app has ads.

* Error recognition and recovery: 8/10
Not many points of error, but the error messages I did get were informative and helpful.

* Help and documentation: 10/10
On pages where the user has not already given the necessary info, instructions are given. Additionally, on the first open, a short tour of the app is given.

4. Sketches:
Each of the sketches helped in analyzing possible pathways for the user interface. By creating sketches separately and bringing them together, we were able to predict user recognition and potential error checking for pre-stages of usability testing.

Keeping in mind our previous heuristic evaluations surrounding competitive market analysis, we were able to ensure key features were implemented for future high-fidelity steps. Some of the key features included, but are not limited to, "back/home" buttons, settings option, recipe deck, communications section, template, and ideation section.
  
6. User Testing:
The software engineering team demonstrated their current progress on the product to other software engineers and collected feedback on the questions we proposed.

Is it more useful to start on the menu home page, or would it be more helpful to start from your personal recipes?
Users suggested that you should start from your personal recipes because when you’re working in a bar environment and need to look up something quickly, it would be easier to start from your recipes. They also suggested that functionality to view recent searches to quickly jump back into a recipe would be useful.

Is there any feature that is missing (or lacking) that you would need within the app?
Users suggested ratings for recipes, pictures of the final products, creating new recipes that are spin-offs of other recipes, the level of difficulty of making each recipe, and the average amount of time to create each recipe.

How would our users think about creating a new recipe? Template? Original/blank screen, etc.?
User feedback suggested creating new recipes from a template because it’s more user-friendly.


## Conclusions

Based on the latest user insights and previously implemented UX research methods, we have determined it is advantageous to ensure users are directed to the recipe catalog as the home page of The Culinary Collab. Additionally, we have gathered that users may be more inclined to interact by sharing and collaborating with friends lists if a rating system is implemented within the recipe catalogs. On another note, we found through research methods that implementing a search function would be best practice to help navigate through sections within the website and provide more efficient use when actively using The Culinary Collab in a high-volume use case.

## Caveats

Some limitations we have come across throughout our process thus far are software development attributes. Our call to action for this product is a communications section. Initially, we thought it may be in our product's best interest to have a friends/followers feature to help expand our target audience. However, implementing primary and key features is much more pertinent to our product and deliverable timeline before expanding networks and branching into a social media space.
