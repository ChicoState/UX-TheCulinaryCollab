# The Culinary Collab


## Product Introduction
The Culinary Collab is centered around a collaborative workspace for professionals and hobbyists to create, house, and share recipes from kitchen to bar. Working within an editable environment, our users have the ability to add inventory, create original recipes, and iterate off of classics. The Culinary Collab is the only place you will find that allows for a smart and clean design to house your recipes but also allows our users to share recipes to collaborate with your friends and coworkers [eliminating the need for messy binders, jampacked with hard-to-find recipes and creates a unique environment you won't have to leave, to share, innovate and complete your next best impressive recipe!].
