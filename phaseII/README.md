# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The Culinary Collab is an app for discovering and sharing recipes both a home and industry environment. Users are intended to be able to create, edit, duplicate, and share recipes for both food and drinks. In this sprint, we participated in a Cognitive Walkthrough and produced Wireframes to better understand our users.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

While our app is showing promise, our Cognitive Walkthrough showed some weaknesses we had not previously considered. Our wireframes lacked some major portions of the website, which will need to be added prior to prototyping. Additionally, some conventions were ignored or missing in places that it would have made sense to make use of them. From the other side, after meeting with our software team to align, we found that some of our efforts may have been misdirected. We now have better guidance on what we need to do to further assist the development of Culinary Collab.

## Caveats

While we have some new direction after this feedback, it is important to note that all of it came from either students in the UX class with familiarity in the language of Usability Engineering, or Software Engineering Students, who are familiar with the more technincal elements. This could open us up to blindspots in our direction, that we will ideally resolve in the final phase with our research study.
