# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Culinary Collab is a webapp aimed at bar and food service professionals, as well as the average at-home cook or home bar enthusiast. Storing drink and food recipes, the app aims to provide a sleeker method of sharing, storing, and finding recipes. During this phase of building the app, the UX team has embarked on the journey of actual user usability testing. 

## Methods

### Usability Test

During this phase, we ran usability tests after getting our protocols IRB approval. Our protocols can be found [here](../protocol/). As a part of the Usability Test, we provided participants with 3 tasks, on two variants of the [prototype](../prototypes/).

- Log into the Culinary Collab website.
- Find and edit the amount of Pineapple Juice in a Pina Colada. 
- Find and share a drink recipe with Bourbon in it.

Each of these tasks was designed to best test the efficacy of our decision to use icons instead of worded buttons in our prototype. If you look at the prototype, you'll notice that the login is the same in both variants, designed to give us a baseline task for them. The second and third tasks are more complex, with the second containing 1 major change, and the third containing 2 major changes. This methodology was chosen to check how well the user adapted to these changes, but also help us identify issues that may exist outside those elements.

Outside of the test itself, we acquired participants by asking other members of our Usability Engineering class to sign up for our session, aiming to target people with Food Service or Bartending experience.

## Findings

### Usability Test

In our Usability Test we had several findings:

- In our testing, Variant A and B were equally favored by different candidates.
- Participants that preferred A often cited B feeling like it had more clicks/was less straightforward.
- Sharing was the favorite feature of 5/6 participants.
- The sharing screen consistently confused participants, with them being unsure if it was a contacts menu or message history menu.

Our full data and findings are attached to this report [here](../data/).

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
