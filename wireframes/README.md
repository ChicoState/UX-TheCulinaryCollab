# Wireframes

Wireframe can be found as a pdf [here](wireframe.pdf). Currently, the wireframe goes through the primary planned functionality for the website. Frame 1 goes over the layout for the "My Bar" section, which is the default homepage, and method of browsing existing recipes and inventory. Frame 2 goes over the layout of the "Workshop" section, which includes how to add and edit recipes. Finally, Frame 3 goes over the "Comms" page, which is the social feature of the app.
